## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase structure derived from 56 requirements across 7 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3, 4, 5 can execute in parallel (all depend only on Phase 2)
- [Roadmap]: UK Tax deferred to v2; advanced features (unified view, expiration calendar) placed in Phase 8

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 7 (UK Tax) was deferred to v2, but if it were in scope, it would need deep HMRC Section 104 research
- Gap: FX rate handling for historical transactions -- using single daily rate for MVP, historical rates deferred
- Gap: Options accounting policy (premium reduces cost basis vs separate income) -- decision needed in Phase 6
